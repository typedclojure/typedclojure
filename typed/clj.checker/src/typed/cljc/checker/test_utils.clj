(defn tc-e 
  "Type check an an expression in namespace that :refer's
  all of clojure.core.typed (aliased to t) and aliases clojure.core
  to core.

  Takes one form and then options, and returns the inferred type if the form checks
  with the expected input/output types according to the provided options.
  
  The first form in the options can be a static type syntax scoped
  in the new namespace. This is disambiguated with a call to keyword?
  (literal keywords aren't valid type syntax).
  
  eg. (tc-e (+ 1 1) Num)
      ;=> Num

  Keyword Options:

    :expected-ret An expected ret, evaluated in the current namespace (not the new
                  one that refers c.c.t). Cannot be provided in combination with the implicit
                  first option as a type, as above.
    :ret          Check the return TCResult of this expression against this ret. Evaluated
                  in the current namespace."
