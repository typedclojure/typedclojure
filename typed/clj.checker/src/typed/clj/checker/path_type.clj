; ported from Typed Racket, originally by Andrew Kent
;; returns the result of following a path into a type
;;  Type (Listof PathElem)-> Type
;; Ex. (Pair α ) β'(CarPE) -> α
;; resolved is the set of resolved types so far at a particular
;; path - it ensures we are making progress, that we do not
;; continue unfolding types infinitely while not progressing.
;; It is intentionally reset each time we decrease the
;; paths size on a recursive call, and maintained/extended
;; when the path does not decrease on a recursive call.
