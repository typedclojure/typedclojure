;; A contract, the first argument to the `contract` macro
;; - name : Symbol
;;      a name for the contract, eg. 'int-c
;; - first-order : [Any -> Any]
;;      first order (flat) predicate for the current contract.
;;      Must return true for all inputs that passes the projection, but
;;      can also return true for values that fail the contract.
;;      eg. ifn? for [Int -> Int]
;; - projection : [Blame -> [Any -> Any]]
;;      A curried function that does the actual contract checking.
;;      Takes a Blame object and a value, and returns a new value that
;;      adheres to the current Contract object, otherwise blames Blame.
;;      eg. for the int-c contract:
;;          (fn [b]
;;            (fn [x]
;;              (if (integer? x)
;;                x
;;                (throw-blame b))))
;; - flat? : Boolean
;;      True if this is a flat contract, ie. first-order returns true
;;      for exactly the same values that pass the projection function.
(defrecord Contract [name first-order projection flat?])

;; A Blame object
;; - positive : (U String Symbol)
;;     Positive blame party.
;;     eg. "clojure.core.typed"
;; - negative : (U String Symbol)
;;     Negative blame party.
;;     eg. "Not clojure.core.typed"
;; - name (unused)

;; - file : (U nil String)
;;     File name where contract occurs.
;; - line, column : (U Integer nil)
